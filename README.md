# AkkordKnecht

AkkordKnecht is a Telegram bot that will look up songs for you and conveniently send them to you
as a PDF. It also handles transposing of chords in case you want your favourite song a different key.

## Usage

You can message the bot with /start to get started. Afterwards, you can initiate a search using the
/find [songname] command. It lets you pick between the top 5 songs it can find for your query, previews
your pick and lets you transpose or choose a different one if you like.
